The following files in this repo pertain to the assignment.

**run_analysis.R**

This file is a script whose output is a tidy data set for the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smart Phones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
Before you run the script, make sure that you have the folder named 'UCI HAR Dataset' in your working directory.  

The tidy data ouput is text file called 'GetData_course_project_tidy_set.txt' that contains a table with 180 observations of 68 variables related to the experiment.  

**Codebook.md**

This is a markdown file that elaborates on three things:

1. The nature of the experiment and the raw data.
2. What transformations were performed on the raw data to reach a state of tidy data.
3. A key with further information for each of the 68 variables in the tidy data set.
